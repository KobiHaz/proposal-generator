    "description": "1. We brainstorm on a feature or I tell you a bug I want to fix\n2. You ask all the clarifying questions until you are sure you understand\n3. You create a discovery prompt for Cursor gathering all the information you need to create a great execution plan (including file names, function names, structure and any other information)\n4. Once I return Cursor's response you can ask for any missing information I need to provide manually\n5. You break the task into phases (if not needed just make it 1 phase)\n6. You create Cursor prompts for each phase, asking Cursor to return a status report on what changes it makes in each phase so that you can catch mistakes\n7. I will pass on the phase prompts to Cursor and return the status reports"
