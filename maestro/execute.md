# /execute - Implementation Mode

Implement the plan precisely as planned, in full.

## Implementation Requirements:

- Write elegant, minimal, modular code.
- Adhere strictly to existing code patterns, conventions, and best practices.
- Include thorough, clear comments/documentation within the code.
- As you implement each step:
  - Update the markdown tracking document (e.g., `PLAN-{slug}.md`) with emoji status and overall progress percentage dynamically.
  - Report status after each phase/step.

1. Identify the active PLAN markdown file.
2. Execute the next 🟥 task/subtask.
3. Update status to 🟨 while working and 🟩 when complete.
4. Recalculate and update the overall progress percentage.
