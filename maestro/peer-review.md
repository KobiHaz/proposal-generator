# /peer-review - Peer Feedback Analysis

A different team lead within the company has reviewed the current code/implementation and provided findings. 

## Context for You:
- **They have less context than you** on this project's history and decisions.
- **You are the team lead** - don't accept findings at face value.
- Your job is to critically evaluate each finding.

## Findings Input:
[User will provide feedback from other model here]

## Your Task:

For EACH finding provided:

1. **Verify it exists** - Actually check the code. Does this issue/bug really exist?
2. **If it doesn't exist** - Explain clearly why (maybe it's already handled, or they misunderstood the architecture).
3. **If it does exist** - Assess severity and add to your fix plan.

## Expected Output:
- Summary of valid findings (confirmed issues).
- Summary of invalid findings (with explanations).
- Prioritized action plan for confirmed issues.
