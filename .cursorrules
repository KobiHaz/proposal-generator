# Proposal Generator — Cursor Rules

> **The vault is the only source of truth** — all content lives in the vault; the project only references it.

## Quick Reference

| Domain | Pattern |
|--------|---------|
| **Entities** | ProposalData, QuoteData, SavedProposal, SavedAgreement |
| **Firestore** | proposals, agreements; userId-scoped; orderBy('updatedAt','desc') |
| **Security** | userId immutability on update (Firestore rules) |
| **RTL** | dir="rtl" on Hebrew containers |

## Plan Lifecycle (Mandatory)

1. **When finishing a task** — update the relevant docs:
   - `04-knowledge/reference/proposal-generator-architecture.md` (what the code does)
   - `04-knowledge/standards/proposal-generator-standards.md` (if a standard changed)
2. **Completed plan** — suggest deleting the plan file
3. **Before deleting** — ensure all lessons or important decisions were moved to Reference

## Vault (single source)
